* Remove a column from a data frame by name.
frame$column.name <- NULL
* Add a grid to a plot.
Run the plot command and then execute the command "grid()".
* Multiple plots in one window
par(mfrow=c(<row count>,<column count>))

Plot window acts as a FIFO queue, with commands such as grid() and
abline() operating on the most recently generated plot.

* Writing a function
foo <- function(param1, param2) {
}

* Loading functions from a file
source("filename")

* Filtering factors (hax, THTBABW)
factor.levels <- unique(frame$field)

Examine the resulting factor.levels object to determine the index of
the desired factor value.

frame.flag <- frame$field == factor.levels[index]
